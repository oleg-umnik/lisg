-------------------------------
lISG-0.11.3-alpha :: 2010-07-08
-------------------------------
* Revert fix from 0.11.2-alpha. The reason of error message was
  different, so this fix is pointless.
* Fix the race condition between sending events to main isg and
  reload_tc processes

-------------------------------
lISG-0.11.2-alpha :: 2010-07-07
-------------------------------
* Wrong error message during 'ISG.pl clear' command execution fixed

-------------------------------
lISG-0.11.1-alpha :: 2010-07-07
-------------------------------
* Framed-IP-Address attribute was ignored (regression in 0.11), fixed

-----------------------------
lISG-0.11-alpha :: 2010-07-06
-----------------------------
* IPv4 subnets classification support (refer to README file)

* Services support (refer to README file)

* ISG.pl show_all parameter removed, all sessions are in main list now

* ISG.pl session list output modified

* Use 127.0.0.1 NAS-IP-Address when there is no way to resolve local
  system IP-address

* AVPair's client-mac-address attribute added in RADIUS-requests

* Cisco-Control-Info attribute for <I>nput and <O>utput octets added in
  accounting requests (alongside with Acct-(In|Out)put-Octets/Gigawords)

* $cfg{default_rate} removed, please use explicit "Class" attribute or
  apply service

* All sessions has an unique ID now (even unapproved)

-----------------------------
lISG-0.10-alpha :: 2010-06-09
-----------------------------
* Support for "Acct-Interim-Interval", "Session-Timeout" and "Idle-Timeout"
  attributes in Access-Accept packets

* $cfg{alive_interval} was renamed to $cfg{session_alive_interval}

* $cfg{unlim_alive_interval} was removed permanently, please use proper
  "Acct-Interim-Interval" attribute in RADIUS Access-Accept packets

* Module parameters "session_max_duration" and "session_timeout" was removed,
  please use $cfg{session_max_duration} and $cfg{session_idle_timeout} from
  config.pl

* Don't install 1-to-1 NAT entry when Framed-IP-Address equals to User-name
  (thanks to Abram)

* Do the full session stop and start with re-authentication in case of
  Session-Timeout (previously it looks like accounting counters reset and
  only RADIUS Stop/Start)

* Don't include "Password" attribute in RADIUS accounting requests

* Minor bug fixes and code cleanups

----------------------------
lISG-0.9-alpha :: 2010-04-25
----------------------------
Userspace:
* Using "dev lo" routes for dropping traffic considered incorrect in Linux
  kernel, use blackhole routes now (see README, 1-to-1 NAT section)

Kernel module:
* Potential (impossible?) null-pointer dereference fix
* 64-bit platforms support
* Minor compile warning fix

----------------------------
lISG-0.8-alpha :: 2010-01-31
----------------------------
Userspace:
* Multiple RADIUS servers support (watch config.pl for new declaration)
* $cfg{coa_secret} is back into config
* $cfg{default_speed} is renamed to $cfg{default_rate}
* Child processes auto restart
* Minor bug fixes

Kernel module:
* Zero session counters when its moved from unapproved to approved state

----------------------------
lISG-0.7-alpha :: 2010-01-11
----------------------------
Userspace:
* $cfg{coa_secret} is removed, please use $cfg{radius_secret}
* Change the meaning of $cfg{coa_server}, see config.pl
* Authenticator check for incoming CoA requests according to RFC 2866

----------------------------
lISG-0.6-alpha :: 2010-01-10
----------------------------
Userspace:
* CoA and PoD support (RFC 3576, RFC 5176), see README for reference
* New config.pl option $cfg{nas_identifier} for NAS-Identifier RADIUS attribute
  initialization. If not set, NAS-Identifier will be equal to NAS-IP-Address.
* Minor RADIUS-request attributes rearrange
* `--session-init name' turned into just `--session-init'. Traffic classification
  (f.e. local traffic and internet traffic) will be done in different way in
  future releases.
* All Virtual ports are now referred as "Virtual" type, not "Async"
* Static NAT must be enabled explicitly in config.pl ($cfg{static_nat}, see README)
* Authenticator field in Accounting requests is now calculated according to RFC 2866

Kernel module:
* Using jhash_1word function instead of jhash2 for maximum performance
* Functionality for find session by Session-Id and session IP-address (along with
  Port-Id) was added

* Some minor bug fixes for userspace and kernel module

----------------------------
lISG-0.5-alpha :: 2009-12-28
----------------------------
* Fixed ISGd.pl initialization logic (what to do before fork() and what after this)
* Added NAS-Identifier attribute to all RADIUS packets (equals to NAS-IP-Address)
* Fixed ISG.pl behaviour when there are no sessions. Now it returns nothing.

----------------------------
lISG-0.4-alpha :: 2009-12-25
----------------------------
* lISG doesn't depend on IPTables::libiptc and Time::HiRes modules now
* "/sbin/ip" replaced to "ip" (without command path) in route addition/deletion
* Some minor bug fixes

----------------------------
lISG-0.3-alpha :: 2009-12-24
----------------------------
* This file was started
* Very nice configure script added (modified version of script from ipt_NETFLOW distribution)
* Support for >= 2.6.24 kernels (module compiles cleanly, but not tested)
* Support for iptables > 1.4.2 in libipt_ISG.c, but anyway due to IPTables::libiptc module
  restrictions you have to use iptables 1.4.2. Will be fixed in 0.4-alpha.
